            <h3>Baking</h3>
            <p>
                Baking is more than just a hobby for me; it's a passion. I love the precision of measuring, the mixing, and the aromas that fill my kitchen as my creations bake. From cupcakes to sourdough bread, every baked good has its own story and technique. I enjoy experimenting with new recipes and sharing my baked treats with friends and family. There's truly nothing more satisfying than seeing the joy on someone's face when they taste something you've made from scratch.
